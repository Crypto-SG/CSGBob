To do list

- add confirmation prompt (yes, no do you want to bob)

- delete old /bob message after bob is completed.

- /bob to work as long as it's at the start of a message.

- clean up butler msg. (split into separate module)

- another spec for butler enhancement is keyword parameter ban. if whatever keyword set by admin (e.g. "sginternship" etc etc) has been found, immediate ban and report as spam (if possible). think that would be useful if able to implement

- mute all new joiners, a function that creates a message with the button "unmute me please, I've already read the rules" then admins can add that tg msg link to the end of the welcome msg / pinned msg.
